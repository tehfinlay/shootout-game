3. **Corner Shots**: Aim for the corners where the goalkeeper has less reach
4. **Timing**: Release at the right moment for optimal power
5. **Magnus Effect**: Curved drag patterns create realistic ball spin that affects trajectory
6. **Practice**: The goalkeeper AI learns, so mix up your strategy!
